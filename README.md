# 🧬 Breast Cancer Detection – Python Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on the analysis and prediction of breast cancer using Python. The notebook walks through data exploration, preprocessing, and the use of machine learning models to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

## 🩺 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build a basic breast cancer detection pipeline. It includes:

- Loading and inspecting a breast cancer dataset
- Understanding the features and target labels
- Preprocessing the data for machine learning
- Training and evaluating classification models

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (commonly available via `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visualizations
- **Data Preprocessing**: Feature selection and normalization
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression or other classifiers using scikit-learn
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📁 File Included

- `session1&2(siddhant).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and model implementation

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
